        What is Linux?   
    </h2>

    <p>
        Linux is an operating system just like <br />
        Windows or Mac Os or OS X. <br />
        But unlike these operating systems, <br />
        it is owned by a company respectively <br />
        Windows is owned by Microsoft and Mac os or <br />
        OS X is owned by Apple. <br />
        Linux, tho is not owned by a massive <br />
        company, but rather it is owned by... well <br />
        it is complicated.

        Linux was started by one guy. His name was
        Linus Benedict Torvalds or how many people call him <br />
        Linus Torvalds. And he created linux. He made the os <br />
        open source. Meaning that anyone can make it better or make a clone <br />
        of it. Now that isn't a bad thing. Ofc, if you make a clone <br />
        of Windows or Mac os (OS X) without the companies consent <br />
        then they are surely going to sew you. That's why linux was created. <br />
        It gave people the freedom of creating there own distributions of linux, <br />
        or dis-tros. Without having the fear of getting sewed. <br />
        Linux is itself is very very small. And is mostly useless. <br />
        But the reason is because it doesn't have a direction. <br />
        That's why people make thier own disribution of linux <br />
        so that it may be fit to whatever purpose the have. <br />
        Some thing else to note is, that even if you use Windows or Mac os <br />
        There is a chance that you are some how using linux. <br />
        Many companies use linux. Cause then they would have to make <br />
        their own operating system from scratch.

        Now, what is a linux distribution? Don't get me wrong here, a linux <br />
        distribution is an operating system of it's own. But it is just based of the original <br />
        linux kernel. Let me give you an example of a very popular linux distribution. <br />
        Ubuntu. Ubuntu is not it's own operating system. Well it is but it is based of of something <br />
        It is based of of Debian. What is Debian? Well, See, Ubuntu is based of of <br />
        Debian, and Debian is based of of linux. So we can say that Ubuntu is a linux <br />
        distribution. But what does debian do? Debian actually just adds more features <br />
        like a package manager that is has called 'apt' (like the microsoft store, but it came first). <br />

    <br />

    <p>
        But what uses linux? Well, alot of things. <br />
        Android is run on linux! And anything that can connect to the internet <br />
        (except for laptops of computers or mobile phones) probably has some kind of linux!
    </p>

    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

    <p>
        But why do you want to install linux on your laptop or computer? Well there can be many reasons <br />
        Well there can be many reasons, many you want to have more privacy since linux is open source <br />
        Or maybe you have a old laptop!
